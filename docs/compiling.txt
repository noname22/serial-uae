Compiling UAE
===============

UAE should be able to compile on any platform with a POSIX-like shell
environment, a C compiler and make. Version 2.95 or newer of the GNU C
Compiler is recommended as is GNU make, but alternative compilers and
versions of make may work. Some features may be GCC-specific, however.
Currently, for example, the JIT - the compiler which dynamically
translate 68k opcodes to x86 opcodes - does require GCC (and GAS, the
GNU assembler).


Configuring
===========

The first step to compiling E-UAE is to generate a makefile suitable
for your intended target system. This is done by running the configure
script.

Run ./configure --help to see the list of options that the configure
script supports. Most options will automatically default to
appropriate values.

Here are a selection of the the supported options:

The config script for UAE supports a bunch of compile-time options for
selecting what features are built into UAE. Here's a selection:

--with-sdl-gfx
  Use SDL library for graphics output.  This is recommended.

--with-sdl-sound
  Use SDL library for audio output.


Note that the '--enable-xyz' options all have a '--disable-xyz'
counterpart to disable that feature.


Compiling on MacOS X
--------------------

At the moment, only building against the SDL framework is supported.
Configure with

./configure --with-sdl-gfx --with-sdl-sound

and any other options you fancy.

If you are building on an x86 OS X box, then the SDL test in the
configure script currently fails. It should build okay if you disable
the SDL test. That is, configure with:

./configure --with-sdl-gfx --with-sdl-sound --disable-sdltest

I've not tested this myself, however, since I don't have a MacIntel
box.


Building
--------

Just type 'make' after configuring.
